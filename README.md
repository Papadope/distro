The heart of the [REMnux](https://REMnux.org/) project is the REMnux Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. This distro incorporates many tools for analyzing Windows and Linux malware, examining browser-based threats such as obfuscated JavaScript and taking apart other malicious artifacts. In addition to examining malware within the REMnux environment, forensic investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab environment when performing behavioral malware analysis. 

The majority of REMnux files are located elsewhere. For details about the distro, please [refer to its website](https://REMnux.org/).
